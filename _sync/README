In this folder I place the scripts to synchronize the content of the site generated by jekyll to the remote server with lftp. Refer to the article in linux.com (http://www.linux.com/community/blogs/Using-lftp-to-synchronize-folders-with-a-FTP-account.html) and the lftp man peages for more information about the process.
I'm adding two configuration files as an example.

Upload File (name it as upload.server.com)
-----------
open -u user,password ftp.site.com
mirror -c -e -R /local_directory /remote_directory
exit

Usage:
ftp -f upload.site.com

WARNING: aviod the -e switch if you have other folders in your website that aren't synced with this repository.
